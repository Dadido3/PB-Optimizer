Optimizer
=====

This is going to be an optimizer for the FAsm output of PureBasic.
This includes a parser for FAsm files, an analyser and (later) algorithms to optimize the code.
The analyser can examine the control flow of the instructions, it also generates a list of dependencies between the instructions.

Visualisation of the control flow and dependencies:
